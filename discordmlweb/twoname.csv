'\u1cbc\u1cbc',"@everyone \n He's been here for 6 months. He is out of food. He is stuck on a ship (research station). He vaguely remembers the research on fruit flies he did with his colleagues. He tries to recreate the study, thinking it could be his last hope. While he is waiting for the larvae to develop, he ends up nearly starving, eating some agar (for shock factor lel there is no symbolism). When the flies are finally done growing, he feels satisfied with the results. He feels full after eating the larger flies, but then later is confused when he gets hungry very quickly. After measuring the mass, he realizes that the elongation does not increase meat content that much. He starts going mad, realizing that he spent days worth of battery on maintaining the centrifuges. To him, he has basically sped up his demise, and he is only living for the sake of being alive. After several days of no logging, he finally comes back and discusses how he feels he wasn’t able to leave a footprint on the world. The final log ends with Adi smiling a little right before the little lightbulb in the basement turns off (film this at night so it actually goes dark?)."
