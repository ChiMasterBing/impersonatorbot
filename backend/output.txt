anonymous,and wake up late
anonymous,if I stay up late
anonymous,cuz like
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',oh thats fair
anonymous,just a thought tho
anonymous,yeah I can see that but if you're tired in the morning if you wake up and in the night if you stay up personally i think it's better to be tired in the morning cuz then you can be less rushed
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',but i think my grade went up
anonymous,I tried that and it worked for a bit but I ended up being too tired in the morning and just went back to sleep rip
anonymous,lollll early sleepers
anonymous,and then i fall asleep again
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',i have worse
anonymous,i force myself to sit up
anonymous,like
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',don't worry i struggle with that tio

'\u1cbc\u1cbc',hmmm
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',o dam
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',LOL he said he was failing chem and he had a 93
anonymous,just a thought
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',ill prob do that
anonymous,this might not work for everyone, esp if you can't do work in the morning, but I prefer sleeping ~10:30 and then waking up at 4-5 to get my work done
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',if shes not that good then j watch auerbachs vids
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',aurbach explains rly well
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',thats tru
anonymous,i feel like only a handful of the math 5 teachers are good
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',but liek i dotn pay as much attention
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',daniel version of failing is probably 93 
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',i dotn feel she tachess that well
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',:(((
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',thats tru
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',i didnt presutdy math 5, but im also failing it so 
anonymous,+ no one could take me to school if I did choose to skip
anonymous,+ I actually like math
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',yeah but I didn't prestudy math so I will stop getting good grades if I skip 
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',DANIEL WTMOO

'\u1cbc\u1cbc',and u have a good grade in math prob
'\u1cbc\u1cbc',ur health>>>>>>> math class
anonymous,basically relaxing before u sleep because lying in bed always makes me more awake lmao
anonymous,bc if im thinking abt stuff i will not be falling asleep soon
anonymous,and also smth like j 5-10 min before bed to calm down
anonymous,like within the same hour ish every day
anonymous,ive figured that i need a regular sleep schedule to sleep well
anonymous,And that'll make me tired earlier the following nighf
anonymous,As in I'll wake up super early
anonymous,I can more or less sleep deprive myself for a night and then I'm back on track for normal sleep
anonymous,Maybe your sleep schedule doesnt work like mine
anonymous,Hold on
anonymous,Well
anonymous,But honestly
anonymous,I mean exercise is the best thing
anonymous,xbbdshjss yeahahahah melatonin is prolly a good idea
anonymous,tea bee aych starting to sound like a good idea
anonymous,so I don't think it's that
anonymous,I went to bed at midnight and didn't fall asleep until 2:30
anonymous,i mean
anonymous,You wanna correct ur sleep schedule, like get tired and sleep a couple hours earlier?
anonymous,Dyu go to sleep too late?
anonymous,don't have time in the afternoons either 
anonymous,I usually can fall asleep within 20 minutes so uhhh
anonymous,But it also works the opposite way like if u dint sleep well its gonna be hard to exercise
anonymous,Ye its like a flywheel, the more u exercise the easier it is to fall asleep, and the better you sleep the easier it is to exercise
anonymous,Um exercise is super good for being able to fall asleep
anonymous,Melatonin supplements?
anonymous,Diana :((
anonymous,can i just skip 5th pd pls

anonymous,Just give urself time to figure urself out :D
anonymous,And like diff ppl have diff wants and needs so it's perfectly okay to not know just yet!
anonymous,So it often takes time figuring out what u truly want
anonymous,Like ik i personally used to glorify the idea of a relationship in my head but then realized it wasn't what *i* want and that's okay
anonymous,And that's v valid
anonymous,Ik i say stuff like i want a bf very often, but ik personally that i don't actually want a relationship and that I'm not ready to be emotionally committed to anyone
anonymous,^^
anonymous,ilyyyy
anonymous,you dont have to be ready for a relationship rn; its okay j to take sometimes figuring yourself out xbsbshsh
anonymous,dw allison you are so valid
anonymous,Someone teach me to be emotionally available because it’s actually so bad
